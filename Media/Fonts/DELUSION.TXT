                   --------------------------------------
                    Released as shareware in May 1997.

     Delusion is a hand-drawn novelty font based on a typeface called
     Illusion. All I have seen of Illusion are the words "European
     design" shown in The Solotype Catalogue of 4,147 Display
     Typefaces (Dover Press, 1992).

     Delusion has only the uppercase alphabet, numbers and basic
     punctuation.

     I am releasing this font as shareware and asking for a
     registration fee of $10 (Canadian dollars for Canadian users;
     U.S. dollars or the equivalent of US$10 in local currency for
     users outside Canada).

     Registered users will receive a receipt and notice of any new
     versions or fonts that I release. For Canadian users, the price
     includes GST and, in Quebec, QST.

     Please send your registration fee in the form of a Canadian
     cheque or an international money order, with your name and return
     address, to:

          Jonathan Paterson
          3534 de Lorimier

     This font may not be sold or modified without my written consent.
     Delusion may not be distributed without this text file.

     To avoid loss of quality, please do not convert this font to other 
     formats without checking with me first. Delusion is currently 
     available in four formats (PostScript and TrueType for both 
     Macintosh and Windows) and has been tested in all four formats.
